# Time-Series-Analysis
Used statistical approaches along with python programming language to analyze the time series.
Checked for seasonality, trends, and stationary state.
Applied both: ARIMA (Parametric model) and xGboost (Deep Learning model) to predict the future values of the time series:
- Used statistical methods as well as bult-in methods to get the parameters of ARIMA.
- Visualized the output and calculated the accuracy compared to a test set.
